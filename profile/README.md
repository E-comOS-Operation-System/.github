# E-comOS Operation System Project(EOSP)
**A microkernel for Computer in this Earth Operation System**
## What do we want to do 
Our goal is to build a practical, universal operating system that serves as many usable computers as possible—especially those 'old but functional' devices (like your 2016 ThinkPad X260, or a repurposed 2001 UVC webcam) that still have real-world value.<br>
We’re not here to chase an impossible 'support every device ever made' dream—because that’s how messy, unmaintainable codebases (the kind we all hate) get started. For example: A 1990s computer, with its outdated instruction sets and tiny RAM, would require endless hacky workarounds just to run basic 2025 software (like streaming YouTube). That’s not 'letting go' of old devices—it’s choosing not to bury our core features under layers of legacy compatibility code.<br>
E-comOS focuses on devices where our work matters most: those that can still benefit from a lightweight, free OS without forcing us to maintain a 'code mountain' of one-off fixes. A computer’s worth isn’t about its age—it’s about whether making it run well is a sustainable, rewarding effort for our small team.<br>
### E-comOS's core philosophy
As a microkernel, E-comOS's most important characteristic is its "micro" rather than its "all-encompassing" nature. A few weeks after the project started, we established E-comOS's ultimate philosophy : **everything is a process, everything is an object, everything is a service.**
## The structure of this project
You can break this project down into three parts:<br>
 E-comOS Oparation System Project<br>
|- E-comOS Oparation System Kernel Project<br>
|- E-comOS Operating System Component Project<br>
|_ E-comOS Operating System Component (GUI) Project — RUI<br>
**Some things we have to do ourselves because we are not trying to be a "Unix-like" system**
